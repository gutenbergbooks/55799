<p>Since most of Lassen Volcanic National Park can best be
seen and enjoyed by walking the trails, this booklet is written
to help those who wish to know more about the park. Much
can be observed from the Lassen Park Road, including some
of the best scenery and most interesting geology, but to become
thoroughly acquainted with the park and to appreciate
fully what it has to offer, there is no better way than walking
the trails.</p>
<p>Thirty-four trails are briefly described in this booklet.
Rather than give a complete description of each trail, an
attempt is made to indicate the highlights of each, giving
enough information so that a hiker can decide which trails
will interest him most.</p>
<p>The author would like to express his thanks and appreciation
to a number of persons who have helped to make this
publication possible: To Raymond L. Nelson, former Chief
Park Naturalist, for guidance and sketch maps; Lester D.
Bodine, former Chief Park Ranger; Harold L. Stanley, Robert
Ball, and H. Trickey Lewis, seasonal rangers, for their aid
and information; and to Dorothy Matteson, art department of
Chico State College for the excellent illustrations.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Lassen Volcanic National Park, established on August 9,
1916, and containing more than 160 square miles, is administered
by the National Park Service, U. S. Department of the
Interior.</p>
<p>The National Park System, of which this park is a unit,
is dedicated to conserving the scenic, scientific, and historic
heritage of the United States for the benefit and enjoyment
of its people.</p>
<p>Created in 1849, the Department of the Interior&mdash;America&rsquo;s
Department of Natural Resources&mdash;is concerned with
the management, conservation, and development of the Nation&rsquo;s
water, wildlife, mineral, forest, and park and recreation
resources. It also has major responsibilities for Indian and
Territorial affairs.</p>
<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the Department
works to assure that nonrenewable resources are
developed and used wisely, that park and recreational resources
are conserved for the future, and that renewable resources
make their full contribution to the progress, prosperity,
and security of the United States&mdash;now and in the future.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">USING THE TRAILS: A FEW TIPS FOR BEGINNERS</span></h2>
<p>1. STAY ON THE TRAIL. This is usually a simple matter,
but in a few places animal trails obscure the main trail. On
some trails orange markers are nailed to trees to guide the
hiker, and, on others, rock cairns mark the way.</p>
<p>2. AVOID SHORT CUTS. In the long run, they are not
short cuts, as they use up more energy and are more tiring
than the somewhat longer trail. They are often dangerous
to the person using them and, also, dislodged rocks may injure
hikers below. In addition, they always damage the trail
by filling it with debris and by accelerating erosion.</p>
<p>3. KEEP YOUR BEARINGS. In Lassen Volcanic there
are plenty of landmarks, so this should not be difficult. A
good map will help, and topographic maps of Lassen are
available. If you are going to return via the same trail and
have any doubts about remaining on it, use the Indian method
of looking back frequently.</p>
<p>4. BE CAREFUL WITH FIRE. A campfire should be soaked
and the ashes thoroughly mixed with water until every
ember is out. To build a campfire anywhere except at a
regular campground you must secure a special permit from
a Park Ranger. Do not smoke while hiking on the trails.
When you want a smoke, sit down, break your match before
throwing it away and completely extinguish the butt before
leaving.</p>
<p>5. KEEP TOGETHER. It is the person who is separated
from the rest who gets lost.</p>
<p>6. CONSERVE YOUR STRENGTH. The elevations in Lassen
Volcanic are considerably higher than most people are
used to, and you may tire more easily. If you start out at
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
a pace which seems slow you are more likely to finish than
if you hurry. Rest often.</p>
<p>7. CARRY A LIGHT AND COMFORTABLE PACK.</p>
<p>8. CARRY YOUR OWN WATER unless you know the
area. The water in the streams should be pure, but the National
Park Service cannot guarantee it against human pollution.
Snow may be used, but only a little at a time, in order
to prevent cramps.</p>
<p>9. KEEP THE TRAILS FREE FROM LITTER. The beauty
of clean, wild places is so fragile even a bit of paper dropped
can mar it.</p>
<p>10. WEAR PROPER CLOTHING&mdash;hiking boots for extensive
or rugged hikes, and light but warm clothing. A light
jacket is recommended, as hot summer days often cool quickly.</p>
<p>11. PLAN YOUR HIKE. By careful utilization of your time
you will be able to see more and have a more enjoyable trip.
Allow plenty of time. Usually it is more satisfying to thoroughly
explore a few sections than to hurriedly try to see
everything.</p>
<p>12. CONSIDER comfort items such as, bandaids, mosquito
repellant, sun glasses, suntan lotion.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">THE TRAILS</span></h2>
<p>No attempt is made to give a complete description of any
trail, but instead to give sufficient information to enable a
prospective user to know if he is likely to find a particular
one interesting. Before the description of each trail, the following
items are given: Starting point, distance, topography,
time, and features. Many starting points are at guide marker
numbers which are referred to in the <i>Road Guide to Lassen
Volcanic National Park</i>. &ldquo;Topography&rdquo; refers to the vertical
rise or fall. For example a &ldquo;descent of 500 feet&rdquo; means a
drop in elevation of 500 feet. As &ldquo;Time&rdquo; varies considerably
among different persons; an attempt is made to indicate the
time needed for a leisurely hike. A young person in good
condition will require less time than indicated, while a bird
watcher, photographer, or naturalist might take much
longer.</p>
<p>It is hoped that with these items indicated, as well as a
description of the more interesting features of each trail, you
will be able to decide which trails will offer the greatest satisfaction
and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Opening of the trails in the park varies from year to
year according to the amount of snow during the previous
winter. During July, August and September most of the trails
are open.</p>
<p>The following tables of opening dates are for years of
average snowfall, and the actual dates will vary from two
weeks earlier to two weeks later than indicated. Trails at
lower elevations and on open slopes facing south will be
available as much as a month earlier than higher trails on
north slopes, or trails through heavy forest. Trail crews attempt
to open some trails early, especially the Lassen Peak
and Bumpass Hell trails. Even though snow has melted,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
down trees may prevent easy hiking until trail crews can find
time to work the trails.</p>

<p>For sheer beauty and rugged mountain scenery the Brokeoff trail
is one of the best in Lassen. From the entrance station it climbs
steadily through open meadows and forest for two miles and then
through the scattered hemlocks and finally above timberline to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
top. Forest Lake is near the trail, and is a good objective for a leisurely
nature walk. A wide variety of wildflowers will be found changing
with the seasons, and the Brewer mountainheath produces an outstanding
display. Birds frequently seen include juncos, chickadees, western
tanagers, flycatchers, and a number of others. Deer are common.</p>
<p>Beyond Forest Lake the forest becomes more open. At the west end
of the mountain just before the last half mile of climb, there is a good
view of Mt. Shasta. From the top of the mountain there are good views
of Lassen Peak, Conard, Chaos Crags, Diller, Shasta, and other mountains
of the vicinity. Also, the view of the old Tehama caldera is
excellent from this point.</p>
<p>Pikas are sometimes seen among the rocks near the top, and
marmots among the rocks at lower elevations.</p>
<p>Snow is likely to be found in places along the trail until about
mid-August, and there is usually too much snow for climbing before
mid-July.</p>

<p>Mill Creek Falls is the highest waterfall in the park with a drop
of 75 feet. It is at the junction of East Sulphur and Bumpass creeks.
Because of the surrounding forest and rugged terrain there are only two
or three points from which it can be photographed.</p>
<p>The trail descends to the crossing of West Sulphur Creek, crosses
an open hillside and follows through forested areas to the falls. Deer
are likely to be seen as well as a variety of birds. Mule-ears, also called
wyethia, is the common wildflower that covers the open hillsides. Many
other wildflowers, including the blue and white stickseed, can be seen.
There are good views of Brokeoff Mountain and Mount Diller.</p>
<p>There are no fish in the streams near the falls nor for some distance
below as there is too much sulphur from the thermal areas above.
Farther down, the water is diluted sufficiently for fish to live.</p>
<p>The trail continues beyond the crossing of East Sulphur and
Bumpass creeks to Kings Creek Campground.

<p>These small lakes are in a cirque below the rim of the old Mount
Tehama caldera. From them excellent views of Mount Diller and
Diamond Peak can be seen. You will find good subjects for pictures,
and naturalists will find a variety of flowers (including the striking
leopard lily), birds, trees, and probably deer.</p>
<p>The trail follows the ridge directly above the parking area for about
a half mile, going through red fir and white pine forests. It then crosses
an open hillside and finally goes over the moraine below the lakes.
When the water is high the two lakes are joined into one. Above the
lakes game trails go up the side of the Tehama rim, which is steep and
covered with loose rock. Only experienced hikers should continue, and
never alone.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Sulphur Works&rdquo; was given to this area when two men,
Boarman and Supan, tried unsuccessfully to develop the sulphur and
clay properties in 1865. The hydrothermal activity consists of hot
springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. As a result of the hydrothermal
activity a number of different minerals are deposited in the area giving
it pastel shades of yellow, orange, green, and red. Some of the minerals
found are powdery opal, chalcedony, hematite, pyrite, kaolinite, alunite,
and sulphur.</p>
<p>It is believed that this is part of the vent system of the ancient volcano,
Mount Tehama, which collapsed thousands of years ago. Signs
posted along the trail explain the various features. This is the only
hydrothermal area close to the park road.</p>
<p>As crusts may be thin with boiling water underneath, visitors are
warned to stay on the trail.</p>

<p>Bumpass Hell is the largest hydrothermal area in the park, and the
trail to it is one of the most scenic. Because of the popularity of this
trail it is usually opened around July 1, although occasionally the snow
is too deep and opening has to be postponed. The first mile is an open
and sparsely wooded mountainside with grand views of Lassen, Brokeoff,
Diller, and Diamond peaks, as well as the more distant Sierra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The hydrothermal area can be seen from the summit of the trail.
Dropping into the area the trail passes by a number of hot springs,
steam vents, mud pots and boiling pools. A variety of trees and wildflowers
are along the trail, chiefly mountain hemlock and white-bark
pine, silver leaf lupine, red penstemon, bog kalmia and other flowers.
Birds, too, are abundant, and deer, marmots, and pikas may be encountered.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the trail is a box with self-guiding leaflets
describing the numbered points of interest on the trail. We urge you
to use them. You are warned to stay on the established trails as crusts
are thin over some hot areas.</p>

<p>Following the trail from Bumpass Hell to the Kings Creek campground
furnishes an interesting variation from the usual round trip.
Starting at stake 23 on the Bumpass Hell self-guiding trail, it crosses
the creek and leaves the basin on the east side. It then goes downgrade
for 1&frac12; miles to Cold Boiling Lake. Along this section of the trail are
good views of Mount Conard and Crumbaugh Lake, and the wildflower
display, especially lupine, is exceptionally good in the open places where
seeps provide moisture.</p>
<p>Cold gas bubbles are continuously coming from Cold Boiling Lake,
hence its name. From Cold Boiling Lake the trail is in the open, passing
by clumps of mountain hemlock and other trees.</p>
<p>By arranging for pick up at Kings Creek, this trail makes an ideal
downhill hike, and cuts the time in half.</p>

<p>Although persons of all ages have climbed Lassen Peak, it is not
recommended for children under 4, unless carried part way, nor for
adults past 70, unless in exceptionally good physical condition. Experienced
hikers will find it a comparatively easy hike. But many who
climb it are not experienced and may suffer mildly from being winded
and from tired muscles and feet. Many people do not allow enough
time for the trip. By starting slowly and resting often, most people
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
should be able to reach the summit and experience the thrill of being
on &ldquo;top of the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The mountain Chickadee and Clark&rsquo;s nutcracker are commonly seen
along the trail. The gnarled mountain hemlocks and white-bark pines
at timberline, clinging tenaciously to the windswept slopes, are truly
picturesque. Views of distant peaks and lakes are magnificent. On the
very top, the skunkleaf polemonium blooms profusely in the short,
snow-free season.</p>
<p>Take water (snow won&rsquo;t really quench your thirst) and a sweater
or jacket along. If you walk through the craters on top of the peak, use
extreme caution. DO NOT SHORTCUT.</p>
<p>In the event a summer thunder storm develops, it is best to turn
back. Lightning strikes outstanding projections, and the top of Lassen
Peak is a favorite target. Never remain on any mountaintop during a
thunder storm.</p>
<p>Leaflets explaining the past geologic history as well as present
natural history of the peak are available to make your hike more
enjoyable.</p>

<p>These three jewels lie in cirques under the north base of Reading
Peak, and are not difficult to reach. For the photographer they present
plenty of contrasting colors, for the naturalist a variety of trees, flowers,
birds, and animal life.</p>
<p>From the sign at the highway the trail descends rapidly. The trail
forks after 0.2 of a mile, the left fork going to Hat Lake and the right
fork to Terrace Lake. After Terrace Lake it passes along the shore of
Shadow Lake, and then through open woods and meadows for over a
half mile to the Cliff Lake junction. An animal trail goes towards
Reading Peak through a meadow and over a low moraine to Cliff Lake.</p>
<p>Because this trail starts at a high elevation and is largely on north
slopes it is not free from snow as early as many trails of the park.</p>

<p>The first part of this trail is <a href="#trail8">#8</a>, then it continues beyond the Cliff
Lake junction, down to the park road. There is a good variety of trees,
wildflowers, and birds. And for a feeling of being completely in the
wilderness, this trail is ideal, for a few yards off the road there are no
noises of civilization nor other reminders of the bustle of the world.</p>
<p>Beyond the Cliff Lake turnoff the trail descends quite rapidly
through the Open forest, which becomes more dense as it approaches
the lower loop of the road. Lupines, both yellow and blue, are the
predominant flowers along the trail. At higher elevations the mountain
hemlocks are most common, but give way to red firs, white pines, and
ponderosa pines as the trail descends.</p>
<p>By arranging for transportation at guide marker 38 where the trail
crosses the road, one can have an easy hike of about 3 hours. The return
hike uphill will take about twice as long as coming down.</p>

<p>Starting where Trails No. <a href="#trail8">8</a> and <a href="#trail9">9</a> start, 0.2 mile from the road
the left trail fork is followed, and the trail passes through forests and
other natural features similar to No. 8 and 9. A number of good views
of Lassen Peak can be seen along the way. For wildflowers it is one
of the best in the park for variety, with lupine, scarlet gilia, red and
blue penstemon, monkshood, columbine, and many others.</p>
<p>After separating from the Terrace Lake trail it goes through open
forests, then descends rapidly before crossing the east fork of Hat Creek.
Just past this crossing the Paradise Meadows trail turns to the right
(south) while the Hat Creek trail turns to the left. The short trip to
Paradise Meadows is well worth the time, for here you can find one
of the outstanding wildflower displays of the park. The Hat Creek trail
descends through the forests to the Devastated Area and Hat Lake,
reaching the park road at guide marker 42. By arranging transportation
at Hat Lake, the hike is an easy one, taking about 2&frac12; hours. The
round trip will require 6 or 7 hours.</p>

<p>This little-traveled area is excellent for birds, wildflowers, and deer.
Cold Boiling Lake is so named because gas bubbles are continually rising
at some points near the shore. The meadow by Crumbaugh Lake has
a variety of wildflowers and Conard Meadows is ideal for wildlife.
There are no fish in either lake, as they will not live when introduced.</p>
<p>The trail is fairly level to Cold Boiling Lake, and then descends
to Crumbaugh Lake. It is level to Conard Meadows, and from there
to Mill Creek Falls descends by a steep grade
(see <a href="#trail2">Mill Creek Falls trail</a>).
A one-way trip to the Sulphur Works campground, arranging for
transportation at the lower end, makes an ideal, easy, half-day hike.</p>

<p>About half a mile down, the trail splits. It is recommended that
the left trail be followed downhill, where it rejoins the other section.
The right fork follows the cascades, and is much easier to climb on
the return trip. The trail goes down through pine and fir forests, and
over a meadow where flowers bloom all summer. Here one can find
the leopard lily, grass-of-parnassus, and many others. Watch for glacial
polishing on the rocks along the way.</p>
<p>Morning is the best time to photograph the falls, as later in the day
(after 2:00 p.m.) they are in shadow. The height of the falls is about
30 feet.</p>
<p>Follow the beautiful cascades (left) on the return trip. Watch for
mountainash, as this is one of the few places one can see this small,
shrublike tree that produces clumps of brilliant red berries in late
August and September.</p>
<p>Below the falls the trail continues downhill to Drakesbad, another
2.5 miles.</p>

<p>This is one of the two main trails to the east part of the park.
Horseshoe Lake can also be reached by a dirt road from Chester.
If transportation can be arranged this trail will make a comparatively
easy day&rsquo;s hike. There is a campground at Horseshoe Lake, so it can
make a good objective for an overnight hike. Hardy hikers can make
the round trip in one day.</p>
<p>The first part of the trip is most of <a href="#trail13">No. 13</a>, and from Upper Twin
Lake the trail goes south and passes close to the base of Crater Butte.
Part of the trip is in open meadows and part through fir-pine forest.</p>
<p>An interesting variation for a round trip is to return via Grassy
Swale Creek. (See <a href="#trail15">No. 15</a>, Summit Lake to Horseshoe Lake via Grassy

<p>Chaos Crags were formed by lava being forced upward and hardening
in place, similar to squeezing toothpaste out of a tube. Considerable
volcanic activity took place in the crater at the north base of the Crags.
As a result of this activity a huge landslide occurred, strewing rocks
over 2&frac12; square miles, including the area around Manzanita and Reflection
lakes. This rock slide is called Chaos Jumbles.</p>
<p>The trail follows through pine-fir forests close to the edge of the
Jumbles. Many saprophytes can be seen along the trail, together with
pipsissewa and pyrolas.</p>
<p>The crater at the base of the Crags is filled with snow early in the
season, later melting to form a small lake which may dry up toward
the end of the summer.</p>
<p>The trees in the Jumbles are small, but in spite of their size, many
are over 250 years old. From the age of the oldest trees it is estimated
that the eruption and landslide occurred about 1690.</p>

<p>This is one of the most perfectly formed cinder cones in the United
States, and one of the most recent. In the spring of 1851, pioneers
following Emigrant, or Nobles, Trail saw the results of the previous
winter&rsquo;s eruption.</p>
<p>For persons interested in geology or photography this trail is a must.
It goes through open forest for about 1.5 miles, close to the base of the
cone, and the rest of the trail is in the open. The trail up the cone is
fairly steep, and is in loose Cinders, making climbing similar to what
it would be in loose sand. The climb is not difficult if made with
frequent rest stops. High shoes or boots are advisable.</p>
<p>The Cinder Cone Summit commands excellent views of Lassen,
Prospect, Harkness, and other mountains, of Butte and Snag Lakes, and
of the Fantastic Lava Beds and Painted Dunes. A trail completely encircles
the double crater, and a spur goes down into the crater. Another
trail continues down the south side of the cone and encircles it, adding
another mile for a 5 mile round trip. It passes near the 1851 vent from
which lava flowed. This is now a small ice grotto.</p>

<p>The first 2 miles is trail <a href="#trail25">No. 25</a>, Butte Lake. From the Widow
Lake trail are scenic views of Cinder Cone, Lassen Peak, Prospect Peak,
Mount Harkness, and many other mountains of the vicinity. From the
south end of Butte Lake the trail climbs rapidly, about 1,000 feet in
2 miles.</p>
<p>From Widow Lake the trail continues south, past the Red Cinder
Cone to Jakey Lake (6 miles), and on to Juniper Lake (10 miles).</p>

<p>The first 2 miles is Trail <a href="#trail25">No. 25</a>, Butte Lake. From the south end
of Butte Lake there are two trails. One, not maintained by the Park
Service, goes by the base of the lava flow, and the other goes through
the forest to Snag Lake. Along the lava flow one can easily picture
the volcanic activity as the trail winds close to huge basalt blocks.</p>
<p>The two trails come together at the bay on the east shore and one
trail continues to the south end of the lake. From this point a trail
leads to Juniper Lake, another to Horseshoe Lake, and another around
Snag Lake and back to Butte Lake via the Cinder Cone. The total distances
from Butte Lake are: to Juniper or Horseshoe lakes, 10 miles;
and around Snag Lake and the Cinder Cone back to Butte Lake,
13 miles.</p>

<p>In the meadow northeast of the Horseshoe Lake Ranger Station the
remains of an early settler&rsquo;s cabin can be seen, and many wildflowers
and birds. The trail follows Grassy Creek much of the way to Snag
Lake.</p>
<p>Snag Lake was created by lava flows from Cinder Cone damming
Grassy Creek. The trees that were killed slowly rotted and fell into
the lake, but in the early days of the park there were many standing
snags to be seen. Since the lake seeps through lava, the level varies
considerably from year to year and season to season, depending on the
rains.</p>
<p>Trails follow both the east and west sides of Snag Lake, continuing
to Butte Lake. (See Trail <a href="#trail27">No. 27</a>.)</p>

<p>Wildflowers bloom profusely in Cameron Meadows during July and
often into August, and it is a good area for birds and deer. Here, also,
are the remains of an early settler&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>The trail is shaded by ponderosa pine and fir forest most of the
way, except for a short stretch at Cameron Meadows. From here it
swings close to the east fork of Grassy Creek and continues on to Snag
Lake.</p>

<p>Inspiration Point is well named, as it affords some of the finest
views of Lassen, Harkness, Prospect, and more distant mountains. Snag,
Butte, and Juniper lakes are in full view, as well as Cameron Meadows
and Cinder Cone. To the southeast of the trail, as you approach
Inspiration Point, look for the fine specimens of western juniper. The
trail climbs steadily through western white pine and red fir timber to
the open area of the point. Various birds may be seen as well as deer
and small mammals.</p>

are views of Juniper Lake, Lassen and other peaks. Many consider it
the most beautiful lake in Lassen. A relatively easy hike through forests

<p>The trail winds upward through the pine-fir forest. On top of Mount
Harkness is the only fire lookout station in the park. From it are outstanding
views of Juniper Lake and Lassen, Brokeoff, Prospect, and
other peaks in the park, as well as the Sierra to the south and other
mountains to the east and north. On top, the brilliant red bloom of the
smooth cycladenia brightens the rocky slopes during July.</p>
<p>The lookout is staffed during the summer months and usually these
people are glad to have visitors provided water or food are not requested.
All of their supplies must be packed to the mountain top.</p>
<p>By proceeding down the west side of Mount Harkness, then turning
northeast along the shores of Juniper Lake, an interesting all-day hike
can be had. The round trip will require about 6 hours and involve
about 5&frac12; miles of hiking.</p>

<p>A number of steam vents are located under Boiling Springs Lake,
keeping the temperature of the lake around 125 degrees. The mudpots
on the southeast shore are among the best in the park. Their coloring
is magnificent.</p>
<p>The trail crosses a meadow and then goes through forest to the
lake and around it. Trees include incense-cedar, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir,
white fir, sugar pine, and others. A variety of wildflowers are found,
and it is a good area to observe birds.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the trail hikers can pick up a leaflet describing
44 points of interest. These refer to trees, shrubs, flowers, geology, and
other nature subjects. This is a relatively easy walk and one can profitably
spend half a day using the leaflet.</p>

<p>This hydrothermal area is larger than the Sulphur Works, smaller
than Bumpass Hell, and differs from both. Hot Springs Creek runs
through the area, and on a shelf just above this creek are a number of
mudpots. Whoever named this area apparently imagined the devil
cooking over these pots. The area extends above and beyond the mudpots
with a number of steam vents on the side of the hill. And at the
lower end are a group of trees which were killed quite recently when
new vents opened up. In exploring the hot springs area, hikers should
be extremely careful as crusts may be thin and trails thru the area have
not been established.</p>
<p>The trail to Devil&rsquo;s Kitchen crosses a meadow near Drakesbad
(where one should look for wildflowers) and enters the forest. Just
beyond the meadow are some dead snags where marmots are frequently
seen. Further along, just below the trail and in the creek are some
beaver dams.</p>
<p>This is an excellent trail for those interested in biology and geology.</p>

<p>These trails are shown on the topographic map of Lassen
Volcanic National Park.</p>
<p>Experienced hikers may want to visit places not on the
trails, and with a topographic map as a guide should be able
to go to a number of places in comparative safety. But beginners
should stick to the established trails. Before venturing
off the trails one should consult with a park ranger.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
